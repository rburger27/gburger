Hands-On: Robot Store Day One
Now that you have an understanding of jQuery, its time to put that knowledge to work. In this Hands-On exercise, you will add jQuery to the Robot Store you have added to in the previous hands-on project. Hands-On projects are completed outside of the browser, using your IDE, or editor of choice.

Description
You should leverage what you have learned about jQuery as follows:

You should have the Robot Store on your computer from the previous CSS Hands-On. From this, you will need to add some functionality using jQuery to meet the requirements below.

Requirements
Highlight the active input on the Contact page to indicate to the user where they are in the form.

Remove the alert from the Hardware page, using jQuery capture that data and log it to the console.
Use the search bar to filter the Robots list and what is displayed.
Tip! If I start to type Butler in the search bar, the other Robots should disappear and leave behind Butler.Bot.
Bonus Add a loading page to the site that is displayed before the user enters the store.
